pacing between the aisles of the 14th unnervingly,
lost in the trail of cards

a ring amid the beating(travelled)
flush sentiment

chaos on both ends is to be known such a relief
possibly rather ordered calls
would be utmost trist

as to why melt down
why depart
looks down at the cluster of lights
blindingly golden at the last sight
to stare into the april emptiness of which they shared
only the audible tingling of the familiar to recall with

return to yours uncharted everyday
across the hill
to nudge
